# AI Integration in CodeHawk

This document details how CodeHawk integrates with AI models to provide intelligent code suggestions and insights beyond traditional static analysis.

## AI Capabilities in CodeHawk

CodeHawk uses AI models to enhance code analysis in several ways:

1. **Context-Aware Code Suggestions**: Understanding code intent and providing relevant improvements
2. **Complex Refactoring Recommendations**: Identifying opportunities for significant code restructuring
3. **Bug Prediction**: Detecting potential bugs that aren't obvious from static analysis
4. **Code Explanations**: Generating human-readable explanations of complex code
5. **Documentation Generation**: Creating or improving code documentation
6. **Best Practice Recommendations**: Suggesting language-specific and general coding best practices
7. **Performance Optimization**: Identifying areas for performance improvement

## AI Service Architecture

### Multi-Provider Approach

CodeHawk implements a pluggable architecture that supports multiple AI providers:

1. **OpenAI Provider**:
   - Models: GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4
   - Best for: Complex suggestions, understanding code intent, generating explanations
   - Considerations: Higher cost, external API dependency

2. **Anthropic Provider**:
   - Models: Claude, Claude Instant
   - Best for: Detailed code explanations, nuanced considerations
   - Considerations: Medium cost, external API dependency

3. **Local Models Provider**:
   - Models: CodeLlama, Llama-2-Code, etc.
   - Best for: Privacy-sensitive environments, lower latency requirements
   - Considerations: Lower accuracy, higher resource requirements

4. **Custom/Self-hosted Provider**:
   - Models: Fine-tuned models on organization's codebase
   - Best for: Organization-specific patterns and standards
   - Considerations: Requires training resources, ongoing maintenance

### Provider Selection Logic

CodeHawk selects which provider to use based on:

1. **Task Complexity**: More complex tasks use more capable models
2. **User Configuration**: Enterprise settings may enforce specific providers
3. **Performance Requirements**: Time-sensitive suggestions use faster models
4. **Privacy Settings**: Organizations with strict data policies use local models
5. **Cost Optimization**: Budget constraints may favor cheaper models
6. **Availability**: Fallback options if a provider is unavailable

## Prompt Engineering

### Prompt Structure

CodeHawk uses carefully engineered prompts to get high-quality results from AI models:

```
<SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS>
You are CodeHawk, an AI assistant specialized in code analysis and improvement.
Your task is to analyze code and provide specific, actionable suggestions.
Focus on: [specific focus areas]
Respond in the specified JSON format.
</SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS>

<CONTEXT>
Language: [programming language]
File: [filename or context]
Known issues: [issues already detected by linters]
</CONTEXT>

<CODE>
[user's code]
</CODE>

<TASK>
[specific task instructions, e.g., "Identify performance issues" or "Suggest documentation improvements"]
</TASK>

<OUTPUT FORMAT>
[JSON schema for expected response]
</OUTPUT FORMAT>
```

### Language-Specific Prompting

Each supported language has specialized prompts that incorporate:

- Language-specific best practices
- Common frameworks and libraries
- Idiomatic patterns
- Performance considerations

### Context Window Optimization

For larger codebases, CodeHawk optimizes the use of limited context windows:

1. **Code Chunking**: Breaking large files into manageable chunks
2. **Import/Dependency Summarization**: Providing summaries of imported modules
3. **Relevant Context Extraction**: Including only the most relevant parts of the code
4. **Progressive Analysis**: Building up understanding through multiple prompts

## Response Processing

### JSON Response Structure

AI responses are structured in a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "line": 5,
      "column": 10,
      "message": "Use a more descriptive variable name than 'x'",
      "severity": "suggestion",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "fix": {
        "description": "Rename variable to 'userCount'",
        "replacement": "const userCount = getUserCount();"
      },
      "reasoning": "More descriptive variable names improve code readability and maintenance."
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "This function retrieves user data but lacks error handling...",
  "complexity_analysis": {
    "cognitive_complexity": "medium",
    "areas_of_concern": ["Error handling", "Edge cases"]
  }
}
```

### Response Validation and Filtering

All AI-generated responses undergo:

1. **Schema Validation**: Ensuring the response follows the expected format
2. **Quality Filtering**: Removing low-confidence or irrelevant suggestions
3. **Deduplication**: Eliminating duplicate suggestions
4. **Ranking**: Ordering suggestions by relevance and confidence
5. **Integration**: Merging with linting results for a unified view

3. **Response Validation**: Ensuring responses follow expected patterns

## Model Performance and Benchmarks

CodeHawk regularly benchmarks AI models on standard coding datasets:

| Model | HumanEval | MBPP | CodeContests | Avg. Latency | Cost/1K Tokens |
|-------|-----------|------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| GPT-4 | 84% | 78% | 67% | 2.3s | $0.06 |
| Claude-2 | 81% | 75% | 62% | 1.9s | $0.03 |
| CodeLlama-34B | 65% | 59% | 41% | 0.5s | $0.002 |
| Llama-2-Code-13B | 52% | 48% | 33% | 0.3s | $0.001 |

## Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement

CodeHawk implements a feedback system to improve AI suggestions:

1. **User Feedback Collection**:
   - Accept/reject buttons on suggestions
   - Optional detailed feedback
   - Implicit feedback based on applied suggestions

2. **Model Fine-tuning**:
   - Periodic fine-tuning of models based on feedback
   - Organization-specific fine-tuning for enterprise customers

3. **Prompt Evolution**:
   - A/B testing of prompt variations
   - Automated prompt optimization based on response quality

## Implementation Considerations

### Latency Management

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running AI tasks run asynchronously
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic linting results shown immediately, AI suggestions added as they become available
- **Caching**: Common suggestions are cached to reduce latency
- **Predictive Analysis**: Preemptively analyzing code likely to be viewed

### Cost Management

- **Tiered Usage**: Different AI capabilities for different subscription tiers
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing excessive AI usage
- **Efficient Prompting**: Optimizing prompts to reduce token usage
- **Caching and Reuse**: Avoiding redundant AI calls

### Failure Handling

- **Fallback Models**: Using simpler models if primary models fail
- **Graceful Degradation**: Providing basic functionality even without AI
- **Error Transparency**: Clearly communicating when AI features are unavailable
