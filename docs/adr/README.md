# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the CodeHawk project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of the system. Each ADR describes:

- The context and problem statement
- The decision that was made
- The rationale behind the decision
- Consequences of the decision (both positive and negative)
- Alternatives that were considered

## Why use ADRs?

ADRs help us:

- Track the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Onboard new team members by providing context
- Revisit decisions when requirements change
- Understand trade-offs made during development
