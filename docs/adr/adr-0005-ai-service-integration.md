# ADR 0005: AI Service Integration

## Context and Problem Statement

CodeHawk needs to provide intelligent code suggestions that go beyond traditional static analysis. We need to decide:
- How to integrate AI-powered code suggestions into our platform
- Which AI models to use for generating suggestions
- Whether to host models ourselves or use third-party services
- How to balance quality, latency, and cost of AI suggestions
- How to handle data privacy concerns with code analysis

## Decision Drivers

* Quality of code suggestions
* Response time requirements
* Cost of AI model usage
* Data privacy and security considerations
* Ease of integration and maintenance
* Flexibility for future improvements
* Enterprise customer requirements

## Decision

We will use a **multi-provider, pluggable AI service architecture** with the following characteristics:

1. Create an abstraction layer that can work with multiple AI providers
2. Support OpenAI, Anthropic, and custom model deployments
3. Default to hosted services (OpenAI) for SaaS version
4. Provide local model options for enterprise/on-premises deployments
5. Implement model-specific prompt engineering optimizations
6. Use a queue-based processing system for asynchronous suggestions
7. Cache common suggestions to reduce API costs and latency

## Rationale

The multi-provider approach offers several advantages:

1. **Flexibility**: Different use cases may benefit from different models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4 for complex refactoring, Anthropic Claude for explanation generation, smaller local models for basic suggestions).

2. **Privacy Options**: Enterprise customers can choose to keep their code private by using local models.

3. **Future-proofing**: The AI model landscape is evolving rapidly; a pluggable architecture allows us to quickly adopt better models as they emerge.

4. **Cost Optimization**: We can select models based on the complexity of the task, using more expensive models only when necessary.

5. **Availability**: Multiple providers reduce dependency on a single service.

6. **Enterprise Requirements**: On-premises options are essential for many security-conscious organizations.

7. **Response Time Management**: Asynchronous processing allows for better user experience while waiting for model responses.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Greater flexibility in model selection and deployment
* Ability to serve both SaaS and enterprise customers with the same codebase
* Optimization of cost vs. quality for different suggestion types
* Future-proof architecture that can incorporate new models
* Better performance through caching common suggestions

### Negative

* More complex implementation than single-provider approach
* Need to maintain multiple provider integrations
* Challenge of consistent quality across different models
* More complex testing requirements
* Potential cost management challenges

## Implementation Details

1. **AI Service Interface**: Define a common interface that all provider implementations must satisfy.

2. **Provider Implementations**:
   - OpenAI Provider (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
   - Anthropic Provider (Claude)
   - Local Provider (smaller open source models)

3. **Prompt Engineering**: Develop specialized prompts for different tasks:
   - Code quality improvement suggestions
   - Bug detection
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation generation

4. **Caching Layer**: Implement a caching mechanism for common code patterns and suggestions.

5. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use a queue system for non-blocking suggestion generation.

6. **Feedback Mechanism**: Collect user feedback on suggestions to improve future recommendations.

## Alternatives Considered

### Single Provider (OpenAI only)

* **Pros**: Simpler implementation, consistent quality
* **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, privacy concerns for enterprises, potential availability issues

### Self-hosted Models Only

* **Pros**: Complete data privacy, no ongoing API costs
* **Cons**: Higher infrastructure costs, potentially lower quality suggestions, more maintenance

### Rule-based Suggestions Only (No AI)

* **Pros**: Deterministic, fast, no API costs
* **Cons**: Limited to known patterns, lacks contextual understanding, requires manual rule creation

## Additional Context

Our benchmarking showed that OpenAI's GPT-4 currently provides the highest quality code suggestions, but at a higher cost and latency. Anthropic's Claude model offers comparable quality for explanation tasks with slightly lower costs. Local models like CodeLlama provide faster responses but with lower quality, making them suitable for simple suggestions in latency-sensitive contexts.
