# ADR 0001: Use Go for Backend Service

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to select a programming language for the CodeHawk backend service that will:
- Handle concurrent API requests efficiently
- Execute linting processes for multiple languages
- Process code analysis with minimal overhead
- Scale horizontally as demand grows
- Provide good performance for real-time code analysis

## Decision Drivers

* API responsiveness requirements (sub-second response times)
* Memory efficiency for handling multiple concurrent analyses
* Deployment simplicity and container optimization
* Integration capabilities with various linters in different languages
* Team familiarity and development velocity
* Security and type safety

## Decision

We will use **Go (Golang)** for the CodeHawk backend service.

## Rationale

Go offers several advantages that align with our requirements:

1. **Concurrency Model**: Go's goroutines and channels provide an efficient way to handle multiple concurrent code analysis requests, which is essential for our use case.

2. **Performance**: Go's compiled nature offers near-native performance, which is important for processing code analysis quickly.

3. **Memory Efficiency**: Go has a small memory footprint compared to JVM-based languages, allowing us to run more analysis workers on the same hardware.

4. **Static Typing**: Go's static typing helps catch errors at compile time, increasing the reliability of our service.

5. **Standard Library**: Go's rich standard library reduces external dependencies and simplifies deployment.

6. **Cross-Platform**: Go's cross-platform compilation makes it easy to deploy on various environments.

7. **Container Optimization**: Go binaries are small and have minimal dependencies, making them ideal for containerized deployments.

8. **Process Management**: Go excels at spawning and managing external processes, which is necessary for integrating with language-specific linters.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Improved API performance and concurrency handling
* Reduced memory footprint allowing more efficient resource utilization
* Simplified deployment with standalone binaries
* Better stability with compile-time type checking
* Excellent tooling for profiling and debugging

### Negative

* Some team members may need to learn Go
* Integration with some language-specific tooling may require additional work
* Fewer high-level abstractions compared to some other languages
* Less extensive ecosystem for certain specialized tasks

## Alternatives Considered

### Node.js

* **Pros**: Widespread knowledge, large ecosystem, good for API development
* **Cons**: Single-threaded model (despite async), higher memory usage, less suitable for CPU-intensive tasks

### Python

* **Pros**: Great for scientific computing, simple syntax, excellent for prototyping
* **Cons**: Performance limitations, Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) constraints, packaging complexity

### Java/JVM Languages

* **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, good performance after warm-up, robust concurrency
* **Cons**: Higher memory footprint, slower startup time, more complex deployment

### Rust

* **Pros**: Excellent performance, memory safety, modern language features
* **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, longer development time, smaller ecosystem

## Additional Context

During initial prototyping, we benchmarked several approaches and found that Go-based implementation handled concurrent analysis requests 2.7x faster than Node.js and with 3.5x less memory usage, which was a significant factor in this decision.
