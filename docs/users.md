## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Developer Onboarding

Mark is a new developer joining a team that uses CodeHawk. On his first day:

1. Mark clones the repository and opens it in VS Code
2. He's prompted to install the CodeHawk extension
3. The extension automatically picks up the team's configuration
4. As Mark writes his first feature, CodeHawk guides him on team standards
5. When Mark submits his first PR, it passes CodeHawk checks
6. The team lead spends less time on basic issues in code review
7. Mark learns team standards much faster than reading documentation

### Scenario 2: Legacy Code Improvement

Sarah is tasked with improving a legacy codebase:

1. Sarah opens the old codebase in VS Code with CodeHawk
2. She runs a full analysis on the project
3. CodeHawk identifies hundreds of issues, categorized by severity
4. Sarah uses the "Technical Debt" view to prioritize critical issues
5. She applies batch fixes for common problems
6. For complex issues, she uses CodeHawk's AI suggestions
7. Over time, the codebase quality metrics show significant improvement

### Scenario 3: Security Vulnerability Prevention

A team is developing a financial application:

1. A developer writes code that includes a potential SQL injection vulnerability
2. CodeHawk's real-time analysis immediately flags the issue
3. The developer sees the explanation of the security risk
4. They apply the suggested fix using parameterized queries
5. The code passes review and is committed
6. Later, the security team runs a scan and finds no vulnerabilities
7. A potential security incident is prevented before deployment

### Scenario 4: Cross-team Collaboration

Two teams are collaborating on a shared component:

1. Team A creates a component with their coding standards
2. Team B needs to use and extend this component
3. When Team B developers work on the code, CodeHawk shows them Team A's standards
4. CodeHawk automatically applies the correct configuration for each file
5. When Team B submits changes, they automatically follow Team A's patterns
6. Code review is smoother with fewer style-related comments
7. The shared component maintains consistent quality and style
