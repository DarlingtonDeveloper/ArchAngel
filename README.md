## Overview

CodeHawk is a comprehensive code quality platform designed for modern development environments, particularly focused on helping teams who use AI-assisted coding ("vibe coding") to maintain high-quality standards. CodeHawk integrates directly into your development workflow through a VS Code extension and CI/CD integrations, providing real-time feedback, smart suggestions, and automated fixes.

### The Problem We Solve

As AI tools become more common in code generation, traditional code review processes are being challenged. CodeHawk addresses:

1. **Inconsistent Quality**: Ensuring AI-generated code follows best practices
2. **Scalability of Reviews**: Automating repetitive code quality checks
3. **Knowledge Gaps**: Providing context-aware suggestions to improve code
4. **Integration Challenges**: Seamlessly working across the development lifecycle
